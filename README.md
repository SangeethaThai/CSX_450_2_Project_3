## In this Project we will do Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Transaformations on the Boston Housing Dataset.


## About the dataset


### Domain

  The Boston Housing dataset that is built into R.
    

### Dataset Problem Statement

  This is a Linear Regression problem in which, given the census statistics of a Boston Tract, we need to predict the medv or the meadian value of owner-occupied homes in that tract.


### Data Description

  Boston Housing dataset contains census tracts of Boston suburbs from the 1970 census.

  It contains 506 observations and 14 attributes/variables.

  The first 13 attributes/variables are features and the last attribute medv is the target.

  All attributes except chas are of type numeric and chas is binary-valued i.e., a categorical variable (if tract bounds the Charles river it is 1, else it is 0).

  The following is a list of all the attributes of the dataset along with a short description.

  #### crim
  Per capita crime rate by town.

  #### zn
  Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

  #### indus
  Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

  #### chas
  Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

  #### nox
  Nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

  #### rm
  Average number of rooms per dwelling.

  #### age
  Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

  #### dis
  Weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.

  #### rad
  Index of accessibility to radial highways.

  #### tax
  Full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.

  #### ptratio
  Pupil-teacher ratio by town.

  #### black
  1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.

  #### lstat
  Lower status of the population (percent).

  #### medv
  Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s.
